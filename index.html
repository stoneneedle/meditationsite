        <h1>What are the benefits of meditation?</h1>
        <p>Meditation can improve your life in several areas, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stress & Anxiety Reduction:</strong> When you meditate, not only does it help with muscle relaxation, it allows your mind to change from a focused to an unfocused state. During unfocused states, we often let our thoughts go and may work out problems or notice when we get stuck in an unproductive pattern of thought. In focused states, we can concentrate on breathing, bodily sensations, and positive affirmations that amplify the mind's natural abilities to maintain wellness.</li>
          <li><strong>Increased Gratitude:</strong> When meditating with gratitude, we can bring greater easefulness to our own lives and the lives of those we care about.</li>
          <li><strong>Greater Acuity:</strong> Many tasks in our lives require careful study and a high degree of concentration. When we meditate, we strengthen our mind's innate focusing muscle, and this can allow us to study and retain more knowledge from study over longer periods of time.</li>
