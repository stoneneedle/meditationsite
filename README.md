## Project 1 -- Meditation Supplies Website

This website is designed to sell meditation-related products online. It represents a very basic example of what a front-end interface could look like in HTML/CSS. Although I have been experimenting with JavaScript on my own for some time, our course has not yet begun covering JavaScript, and thus I have refrained from coding in JavaScript yet in this project.
