# Project 1 -- Meditation Supplies Website

This website is designed to sell meditation-related products online. It represents a very basic example of what a front-end interface could look like in HTML/CSS. Although I have been experimenting with JavaScript on my own for some time, our course has not yet begun covering JavaScript, and thus JavaScript is minimal and front-end only (strict mode).

*Please note that all code/ideas taken from other sources is cited in APA format, with an in-text citation in the file and with a main references list here. Note that Hofstra QS tutorial videos are proprietary, and are not available at time of viewing.*
