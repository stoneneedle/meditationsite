# Project 1 -- MedShop: Meditation Supplies Website

## Intro

MedShop is designed to sell meditation-related products online. It represents a very basic example of what a front-end interface could look like in HTML/CSS. Although I have been experimenting with JavaScript on my own for some time, our course has not yet begun covering JavaScript, and thus JavaScript is minimal and front-end only (strict mode).

This design is intended to be fairly minimalist while still being usable as a brainstorm for a website shop layout, as well as an alternative to typical design patterns. Thus it is implemented as a pure HTML/CSS layout, and does not use Bootstrap or any standard design frameworks, since it is a learning and brainstorming tool only.

*Please note that all code/ideas taken from other sources is cited in APA format, with an in-text citation in the file and with a main references list here. Note that Hofstra QS tutorial videos are proprietary, and are not available at time of viewing.*

## User Stories

As a meditation supplies shopper, I want to buy meditation supplies online, so that I can more conveniently acquire specialized goods without leaving home.

As a website content manager, I want to be able to post content easily , so that new products and information can easily be communicated to shoppers as well as casual viewers.

As a web developer, I want to design a website that showcases underutilized design properties such as color inversion or round geometrical shapes, so that I can showcase the abilities learned in the web bootcamp.
